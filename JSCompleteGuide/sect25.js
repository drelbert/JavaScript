//Libraries 
    //packages focused on a few core tasks


//Frameworks
    //packages that add functionalities and a set of rules
    //help with details to free up dev to work on logic 
    //deliver a complete structure for JS apps

    //examples 
        //Angular and Vue with React too
            //Note react is considered a library but is a big one
            //But in its eco system that make up a framework



//React and its psudeo-framework
    //library for building the UI 

    //uses the declarative approach = define the result, not the steps to get there
        //opposed to imperative = define the steps to get the result (the approach for this course)

    
    //components = JS classes : to build UI
