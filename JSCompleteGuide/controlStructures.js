//Control Structures
//For executing code based on condition 

//Conditionals and expressions
    //conditional code execution 
        function doSomething(){
            return baz();
        }

        //Then if(someCondition);  condition = in the end a boolean value
        //run option A = add
        //run option B = divide

//Math operators for calculations 
        // *, +, - and so on

//Assignment operators and incrementing
        //=, +=, ++ 


//Logical operators for T or F for conditions - Booleans and operators 
    //built in JavaScript that yield true or false 
    //they do not return only T or F, not any other type 

    //The core operators 
        // == check for value equality 
        //!= check for value inequality 
        //=== check for value and type equality
        //!== check for value and type inequality

        //> and < check for greater / less than 
        // >= and <= check for value being greater or equal / less than or equal
        // ! check for falsy aka NOT true

//Logiccal AND OR opertors
        //AND = && 
        //OR = ||

        //This allows for multiple functions to evaluate independent of each other


//Operator precedence 
        //with math operators, follow order of operations 


        //while for AND OR operators see MDN Table 


//Falsy and Truthy values 
        //How JS evaluates conditions 
        //treated as true: objects and arrays, non-empty strings, any number not 0
        //treated as false: 0 and empty strings, plus NAN null, undefined 

        // !baz


//Loops
        //doing bax over and over = iteration 

        //has one or more of these 
                //couner = place to start  - bax = 3 
                //exit condition = condition when loop stops  baz = 33
                //iterator = increments the counter given each successive loop 

//Error handling
