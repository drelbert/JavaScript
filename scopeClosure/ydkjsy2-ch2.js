IllustratingLexicalScope 

marblesBucketsBubbles 

lexicalScope = "the model to describe how scope is determined during compilation"

marbles = "variables"

buckets = "functions and blocks"

marbleColor = "determined under which scope(bucket) its created in"

"Variables are declared in specific scopes, which can be thought of as colored marbles from matching-color buckets.",

"Any variable reference that appears in the scope where it was declared, or appears in any deeper nested scopes, will be labeled a marble of that same colorâ€”unless an intervening scope shadows the variable declaration; see Shadowing in Chapter 3.",

'The determination of colored buckets, and the marbles they contain, happens during compilation. This information is used for variable (marble color) "lookups" during code execution.'

buildingOnMetaphors 

"The building represents our program's nested scope collection. The first floor of the building represents the currently executing scope. The top level of the building is the global scope",

"You resolve a target or source variable reference by first looking on the current floor, and if you don't find it, taking the elevator to the next floor (i.e., an outer scope), looking there, then the next, and so on. Once you get to the top floor (the global scope), you either find what you're looking for, or you don't. But you have to stop regardless."
